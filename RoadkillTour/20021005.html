<h2>rest in Batemans Bay</h2>
<h3>the Beach Ideal</h3>

<p>"I think it's about beer o'clock," he said to his girlfriend. Which
is all very well, but by my watch it was only one in the
afternoon. Hardly beer o'clock. Maybe a quarter to beer. Or quarter
past. Depends if you're an optimist or a pessimist. The guy certainly
sounded optimistic.
</p>

<p>The photo is what I felt at the time to be an unimaginatively
engineered road straight up the hill. Like the previous three hills I
had just climbed. Doesn't look so bad in the photo. Maybe I just
needed an excuse for a rest. Taking photos is good for that.
</p>

<p>Which is not really Batemans Bay at all. Closer to Tura Beach. I
didn't take photos in Batemans. And I didn't write any journal entry
so it's kind of misleading to claim that this entry has anything at
all to do with the 5.10 except that I think that's when I heard the
guy say that thing about beer o'clock. Which was a new one on me. It's
probably from the Simpsons, right? Or Cheers. That'd be right. That's
humour for you. Quoting lines from a sitcom.
