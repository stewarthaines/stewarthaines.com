  "qa_why_app_q": "Why does this app exist?",
  "qa_why_app_a": "I wrote it for myself to use experimenting with **scripted content** in EPUB. The EPUB 3 format is mature and well supported, but the tooling for authoring EPUB treats it as a *destination format* - equivalent to a PDF or other proprietary book formats - at the end of a lowest common denominator content pipeline.\n\nThe currently available EPUB Reading Systems (like Apple's Books app, and Cantook by Aldiko) support rich, web-like content because they're based on web browsers. I want to explore the possibilities of EPUB interactivity but none of the existing software I've seen supports the kind of development experience I desire.\n\nThis app does that and meets my needs in its present form.",
  "qa_browsers_q": "Supported Browsers",
  "qa_browsers_a": "The SEED.html app should run as designed on recent **Safari**, **Chrome**, **Edge** and **Firefox** browsers. Other Chromium-based browsers should also work.\n\nThe app will work in these browsers on **iOS**, **macOS**, **Linux**, **Windows** and **Android**.\n\nThe app is available at [stewarthaines.com/epub](https://stewarthaines.com/epub) and can also be downloaded as a self-contained SEED.html file, then run from the local filesystem, whether on a computer or a mobile device.",
  "qa_where_files_q": "Where are my files?",
  "qa_where_files_a": "The SEED.html app runs in your web browser, and uses browser-managed local storage to store your files. **Nothing is sent to a server.**\n\nThe way the files are stored means you are not able to locate them on your local file system - they're only available through the browser app.\n\nThe *'Package EPUB'* button creates a file and downloads it to wherever your browser normally downloads files. Everything is stored in the EPUB, so this is where your files are ultimately.\n\nMy workflow treats the .epub file as the resource I need to back up. I don't tend to rely on the Projects view for storing work. Make sure your .epub files are backed up.\n\n**Technical answer:** They're in either the browser's Origin Private File System or in an IndexedDB store, depending on the browser and whether the app was loaded over `http:` or from a `file:` url.",
  "qa_validation_q": "EPUB Validation",
  "qa_validation_a": "It's important that the packaged epub file passes validation. The SEED.html app can't guarantee that the content will be valid when packaged.\n\nEven a small typo in a css file can cause validation to fail, though the EPUB might still be readable when side-loaded or imported to a device.\n\nI use the [pagina EPUB-Checker](https://pagina.gmbh/startseite/leistungen/publishing-softwareloesungen/epub-checker/) for validation.",
  "qa_reading_apps_q": "EPUB Reading apps",
  "qa_reading_apps_a": "In **2025** I've found good support for EPUB 3 with interactive content in these applications:\n\n- [Books app](https://www.apple.com/apple-books/) on iOS and macOS\n- [Cantook by Aldiko](https://pro.cantook.com/en/l-application-cantook) on Android and iOS\n- [Reasily](https://reasily.blogspot.com/) on Android\n- [Thorium Reader](https://thorium.edrlab.org/) by EDRLab on macOS, Windows andLinux\n- [BookFusion](https://www.bookfusion.com/) on iOS and Android\n- [Lis-a](https://lis-a.fr/en/) on iOS and Android\n\nI expect that there are others I don't know about yet.",
  "qa_freeware_q": "Why a freeware license?",
  "qa_freeware_a": "I want you to be able to use it as much as you like for **personal, non-commercial projects** for no cost to you. You can share it with others under the same terms.\n\nIt's *<u>not</u> open source* at this time.\n\nIf you like using it and want to _contribute_ to support the continuing development that would be great! I have a LiberaPay account here in my name: <script src='/images/button.js'></script> <noscript><a href='https://liberapay.com/stewarthaines/donate'><img alt='Contribute using Liberapay' src='/images/contribute.svg'></a></noscript>",
  "qa_opensource_q": "Why not open source?",
  "qa_opensource_a": "1. I have **no experience** managing an open source project\n2. I have **no enthusiasm** for learning how to manage an open source project\n3. The project's source code was largely generated with a coding agent. I'm not sure which open source license would be suitable. TBD.",
  "qa_commercial_q": "How do I obtain a commercial license?",
  "qa_commercial_a": "1. Get in touch if it's worth it to you to have an agreement. Eventually contribute some money via **LiberaPay**<script src='/images/button.js'></script> <noscript><a href='https://liberapay.com/stewarthaines/donate'><img alt='Contribute using Liberapay' src='/images/contribute.svg'></a></noscript>\n2.

Receive an email from me approving your agreed commercial use of the software",
  "qa_ai_q": "What about AI?",
  "qa_ai_a": "The SEED.html app was developed in **July and August of 2025** with extensive use of [Anthropic's Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) product, mostly using the Sonnet 3.7 and 4 models.\n\nClaude Code is an LLM-powered coding assistant with command-line interface capabilities. The agent wrote **100% of the code and tests** for this project in a javascript framework called **Svelte 5**, which I had no prior experience with.\n\nThere's no active AI in the app - it's just an HTML file that runs locally in your browser. I have no plans to make AI or llm agents part of the app.",
  "qa_accessibility_q": "What about Accessibility?",
  "qa_accessibility_a": "The app is usable **without a mouse** (via keyboard navigation) and should support screen reader software.\n\nI'm sure it could be better.\n\nIf you have something constructive to tell me please get in touch <a href='#on-mastodon'>on mastodon</a>.",
  "qa_markdown_textile_q": "Markdown or Textile?",
  "qa_markdown_textile_a": "The main reason for me using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formatting is its great support in other writing tools. If you have existing workflows or preferences I'd suggest sticking with one of the Markdown libraries from the sample EPUBs.\n\nI use the [Obsidian app](https://obsidian.md/) heavily and am very comfortable with Markdown in this environment.\n\nFor EPUB authoring I lean towards [Textile](https://textile-lang.com) in my projects because of:\n\n- The smaller size of the javascript library\n- The ease of adding attributes (like `id` and `class` and `data-src`)\n- A more explicit relation between the source formatting convention and the ultimate xhtml representation.\n\nI started out assuming Markdown was the only choice, but I'm coming around to using Textile in this environment.\nThe other formats that there are samples for are interesting (Asciidoc, LaTeX )and I hope someone finds good uses for them in EPUBs.",
  "qa_support_q": "Can I get support? Where do I report bugs?",
  "qa_support_a": "I'm **not offering support** at this time. I developed the app for my own use and hope it is of interest to at least a few other people in its current form.\n\nIf you find a *show-stopper* of a bug and really want to tell me about it please get in touch <a href='#on-mastodon'>on mastodon</a>.",
  "qa_languages_q": "What about other languages?",
  "qa_languages_a": "I'm very interested in making the app useful to writers in **non-English languages**, particularly *right-to-left writing systems* and other non-latin based scripts.\n\nI have a weblate project on codeberg for managing localisations.\n\nIf this is something you'd like to help me work through to extend the utility of the app to new users please get in touch <a href='#on-mastodon'>on mastodon</a>.",
  "qa_drm_q": "What about DRM?",
  "qa_drm_a": "People smarter than I am have worked on this and only managed to create easily breakable protections for digital books.\n\nI have **zero time** for thinking about restricting access to digital media created with this software.\n\nUse this app to make stuff for your **friends and family** so you don't need to worry about locking it down.\n",
  "qa_stack_q": "What is the project stack?",
  "qa_stack_a": "Written in **Typescript** using **Svelte 5** with a vite 6.3 dev environment on node v20.18.\n\nBuilds to a single **SEED.html** file using `vite-plugin-singlefile` to inline scripts, styles and other assets.\n\nIt uses browser APIs:\n\n- `Compression Stream` and `Decompression Stream` for packing/unpacking .epub files\n- `OPFS` and `IndexedDB` for storing file data\n- `blob urls` for making assets available for local preview\n\nThis architecture makes it convenient to embed into a web page, like you can see on [stewarthaines.com/epub](https://stewarthaines.com/epub) which is hosted on github pages, and served via the Cloudflare cache.",
  "qa_process_q": "What was the development process?",
  "qa_process_a": "**All application code and tests** for this version of the app were produced using [Anthropic's Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) product, mostly with the Sonnet 3.7 and 4 models.\n\nI previously wrote a version using claude with a **VueJS** stack ([v0.3.0 here while it lasts](https://stewarthaines.com/epub/indexeddb/EDITME.html#/) that included `markdown-it`), and before that wrote a VueJS version \"manually\" (check out v0.2.0 [here](https://stewarthaines.com/epub/full/EDITME.html#/)) that used Remark from the Unified ecosystem.\n\nThe ideas have been well worked over in this process but I expect this is **not the ultimate form** of a scriptable browser-based EPUB authoring environment.",
  "qa_who_q": "Who made this?",
  "qa_who_a": "My name is **Stewart Haines**. I live in Naarm/Melbourne, Australia.\n\nI'm <span id='on-mastodon'>on Mastodon</span> to support this project as [@editme@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@editme) (SEED.html)",
