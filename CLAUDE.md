# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

**PRIMARY FOCUS: `/epub` Directory**

This repository contains Stewart Haines' personal portfolio website, but the agent should focus exclusively on the `/epub` directory and its EPUB creation tools. The `/epub` directory is the main subject of development work and contains:

- EDITME.html app for creating EPUB files from plain text source
- Eleventy-powered catalog system for managing EPUB collections
- Static EPUB resources and feeds

**Root site content (index.html, portfolio projects, etc.) should be ignored unless specifically requested by the user.**

## Architecture

### EPUB Directory (Primary Focus)
- **Main entry**: `/epub/index.html` - Generated by Eleventy from `src/epub-index.njk`
- **Static resources**: EPUB files, OPDS feeds, and tools preserved as-is
- **Source structure**: 
  - `src/epub-index.njk` - Main epub landing page
  - `src/_includes/` - Shared templates

### Root Site (Background/Ignore)
- Legacy static HTML portfolio site
- Preserved via Eleventy passthrough copy
- Not the focus of agent work

## Development Workflow

**Focus on EPUB Directory Development**

### Primary Workflow (EPUB Development)
- **Development**: `npm run dev` - Start development server with live reload at http://localhost:8080/`
  - **Note**: Live reload is excluded for EDITME.html files to prevent corruption of standalone apps
- **Build**: `npm run build` - Generate static site to `_site/` directory
- **Clean**: `npm run clean` - Remove build output
- **Main page**: Work in `src/epub-index.njk` for `/epub/` landing page
- **Templates**: Nunjucks (.njk) templates in `src/_includes/`

### Key URLs When Developing
- `/epub/` - Main EPUB landing page (generated from `src/epub-index.njk`)
- Static resources preserved at original paths (e.g., `/epub/georgia.epub`)

### Root Site (Background Only)
- Root site files are automatically copied via passthrough
- Generally ignore unless specifically requested by user

### Deployment
- Deploy `_site/` directory contents to web server
- Both EPUB content and root site served together

## EPUB-Specific Design Patterns

### Basic Structure
- **Main page**: Simple landing page at `/epub/` generated from `src/epub-index.njk`
- **Template**: Uses `base.njk` layout for consistent site appearance
- **Static preservation**: Original EPUB files, OPDS feeds preserved in `/epub/` root

### Layout Consistency
- **Base template**: Matches root site design with logo, navigation, and styling
- **Responsive**: Uses existing `sh2.css` for consistent appearance
- **Navigation**: Clear link back to main site

## Screenshots and Testing

- The user will run the dev server and provide screenshot captures. Ask them to provide these as needed.
